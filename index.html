            <h2>Where are we?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Wörthersee is Carinthia's largest lake. It is elongated, about 16.5 km (10.3 mi) long and 1.5 km (0.93 mi) wide, and stretches from the outskirts of the Carinthian capital Klagenfurt in the east to the bay of Velden in the west. Situated within the Klagenfurt Basin, its shores are flanked to the north and south by the foothills of the Gurktal Alps and the Karawanks range, all covered with dense forests beyond which snow-capped Alpine peaks are visible. The lake's water is of a distinctive blue-green colour and transparent.</p>

        <div id="bottom">
            <h2>Why Choose us?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>If the views alone were not enough, we have a spacious restaurant that overlooks the lake that can cater to all your needs and dietary request. Numerous sun lounges and a jetty that leads to the lake. Two-person glamourous tents all facing the lake. Firepit for those cold nights where you just want to enjoy star gazing. If that is still not enough, we also provide transportation to the nearest city Klagenfurt. Also a variety of yoga classes which you can choose from.</p>
