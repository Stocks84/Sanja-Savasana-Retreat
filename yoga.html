            <h2>Vinayasa Yoga</h2>

            <br>
            <p>Vinyasa means "to place in a special way" and, in this case, yoga postures. Vinyasa yoga is often considered the most athletic yoga style, and was adapted from ashtanga yoga in the 1980s. Many types of yoga can also be considered "vinyasa flows," such as ashtanga, power yoga, and prana.</p>

            <h2>Hatha Yoga</h2>
            <img src="./assets/Images/hatha.jpg" alt="A couple practicing yoga outside" class="yoga-img-left">
            <br>
            <p>The Sanskrit term "hatha" is an umbrella term for all physical postures of yoga. In the West, hatha yoga simply refers to all the other styles of yoga (ashtanga, Iyengar, etc.) that are grounded in a physical practice. However, there are other branches of yoga such as kriya, raja, and karma yoga that are separate from the physical-based yoga practice. The physical-based yoga is the most popular and has numerous styles.</p>

            <h2>Ashtanga Yoga</h2>
            <img src="./assets/Images/ashtanga.jpg" alt="Older couple on a jetty next to the lake meditating" class="yoga-img-right">
            <br>
            <p>In Sanskrit, ashtanga is translated as "Eight Limb path." In Mysore, India, people gather to practice this form of yoga together at their own pace—if you see Mysore-led ashtanga, it's expected of you to know the series. Vinyasa yoga stems from ashtanga as the flowing style linking breath to movement.</p>

            <h2>Bikram Yoga</h2>
            <img src="./assets/Images/bikram.jpg" alt="Female do a yoga pose on a rock next to a body of water" class="yoga-img-left">
            <br>
            <p>Bikram yoga is named after Bikram Choudhury and features a sequence of set poses in a sauna-like room—typically set to 105 degrees and 40% humidity. Choudhury faced sexual assault and harassment lawsuits in the U.S. and fled to Mexico in 2017. Many studios that were formerly Bikram now practice hot yoga, in an effort to disassociate with the founder. </p>
